                            KEY LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A woman was arrested on a warrant in the Florida Keys for
                            stealing numerous bottles of alcohol from a store.
                            A Monroe County sheriff's deputy was called to a Winn Dixie store on March 23, where
                            managers of the
                            store told him a woman, later identified as Melissa Link, 39, was caught attempting to
                            shoplift a
                            bottle of sake from the store in her purse.
                            One of the managers told the deputy the issue was continuous with the woman.
                            The manager identified her by a previous mugshot.
                            The manager advised the deputy that Link had stolen two bottles of sake, as well as
                            numerous bottles
                            of wine over a five month period, valued at over $750.
                            In April, store management verified there was a total of 60 incidents dating from Nov. 14,
                            2017 to
                            March 23 where 58 bottles of Pinot Grigio and 2 bottles of sake were taken, for a total
                            loss of
                            $756.
                            A warrant was issued for Link's arrest for 60 counts of retail theft.
                            Link was found by a deputy in Key Largo on June 20.
                            Link was continuously aggressive towards deputies and at one point, was hit with pepper
                            spray.
                            In addition to the 60 counts of retail theft, Link is charged with four counts of resisting
                            arrest
                            without violence.
