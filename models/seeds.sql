According to an arrest report, he was wanted on warrants for three misdemeanors and three felonies.\n\nHoward was in the driveway working on his car, deputies said, but when he looked up and saw who was paying him a visit, he slammed the hood shut, jumped in the car and took off.\n\n\"I have to leave,\" he yelled at deputies before peeling out into his backyard and through his neighbor\'s wooden and chain link fences.\n\nMoments later, he bailed from the car and the chase continued.\n\nDarting over fences, Howard managed to escape the deputies. A neighborhood-wide search was on for Howard, which included the Sheriff\'s Office aviation unit, K-9 officers, 20 additional deputies and five officers from the Greenacres Police Department.\n\nHoward, making his way down the street, found an unoccupied house less than 1/4-mile away, deputies said. He broke in and stuffed a duffel bag full of jewelry and electronics.\n\nHe also helped himself to a clean shirt — leaving his sweaty one on the bedroom floor, deputies said.\n\nBefore leaving, he took three Capri Sun juice pouches out of the refrigerator and drank them, discarding them on the back porch.\n\nHe was thirsty, he later told deputies, because he had smoked crack cocaine all day.\n\nFrom there he jumped a few more fences, leaving behind a trail of jewelry.\n\nDown the road on Empire Way, he broke into another home — except this time the homeowner was there. The man told deputies Howard, a man he had never met before, came in through the back door and asked for a glass of water.\n\nThe homeowner told Howard to get out. Howard then peeked out the front door to see if the coast was clear and stepped out.\n\nTwo-and-a-half hours after the search began, a neighbor called 911 about a man running through backyards and helped deputies pinpoint Howard.\n\nLess than a mile south, he was caught in a back yard trying to jump another fence.\n\nDeputies were able to detain him this time. In the yard next door they found the duffel bag of jewelry in a barbecue pit and a laptop computer.\n\nHe was handcuffed and placed in the back of the squad car.\n\nBut deputies said while in the sheriff\'s cruiser, Howard was caught trying to use a paper clip with a bent tip similar to a handcuff key to free himself.\n\nHoward faces a slew of charges, which include driving without a license, burglary, resisting arrest, breaking a fence, fleeing and eluding and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nBefore going to the Palm Beach County Jail, he had to be transported to the hospital to be treated for dehydration, deputies said.\n\nHe is being held at the jail on $35,000 bail.\n\nkjacobson@sunsentinel.com, 561-243-6547 or Twitter @katejacobson','https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-lake-worth-felon-chase-20150723-story.html', DATE(), DATE());

Rivera ended up getting the pizza — and a ride to jail — for free. The 27-year-old was arrested on multiple charges, including larceny and battery. Late Monday, he was still behind bars on $13,500 bail. The crime happened at about 11 p.m. Friday, when Rivera walked into the gas station on West Palmetto Park Road and asked for directions to West Palm, the report said. The employee went to the door and began telling him how to get there. Rivera punched him in the face, head and back, then demanded he hand over all the money in the register, according to the report. The robber grabbed about $200 cash and three cartons of Newport cigarettes valued at $70 each. On his way out of the gas station, Rivera told the employee his friends would shoot him if he called police. The 53-year-old man was later treated for cuts and bruises and a fractured nose, the report said. Rivera opened the door of Tomasso\'s Pizza, then left. A few seconds later, he was back and asking if he could buy some pizza. The employees — who noticed Rivera was sweaty, acting \"sketchy\" and carrying cigarette cartons — told him the restaurant was closed. Despite his offer to pay as much as they wanted, they gave him pizza for free because it was the end of the night. When police showed up outside, Rivera\'s behavior grew more suspicious, according to the report. He thew two cigarette cartons on the ground and tried to hide another behind his pizza box, then went in and out of the bathroom. The employees told the officers.

The \"Hydro Pod,\" as it\'s called, first came to the attention of officials on Wednesday, when vessels called the Coast Guard and complained of a man-propelled bubble floating in the waters off Miami. Officials said the captain of the bubble, Reza Baluchi, was asking which way Bermuda was. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, Baluchi was trying to travel from Miami to Bermuda in the homemade plastic bubble. His only supplies were protein bars, bottles of water and a satellite phone. Capt. Todd Coggeshall tried to convince Baluchi to abandon his voyage, but the man refused. \"I have grave concerns regarding your safety,\" Coggeshall said in a recorded satellite phone call to Baluchi. \"You\'re going to have a very hard time punching through the Gulf Stream to make Bermuda.\" The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man traveling in an inflatable bubble to Bermuda on Saturday after he sent a distress call. (The U.S. Coast Guard) \"No,\" Baluchi replied. \"I\'ve been practicing for two years for this.\" According to a website reportedly belonging to Baluchi, he is an adventurer who does daring tasks to promote peace and raise money for charity. He has survived weeks in Death Valley, biked across six continents and run the perimeter of the United States, the website said. His latest effort was a \"Reze to Bermuda,\" a journey from Miami to Bermuda in his Hydro Pod. He started out from Miami on Tuesday, U.S. Coast Guard officials said. Other vessels told officials Baluchi seemed disoriented on Wednesday and was asking them where Bermuda was. A Coast Guard boat met Baluchi in waters near Miami to explain to him the trip would be risky. He refused to be taken back to the shore, and officials told him he was now at the mercy of the sea, the Coast Guard said. “You understand by your refusal to terminate this voyage you\'re putting yourself in grave danger at the high sea?” Coggeshall said during the phone call. “If you run into trouble, there\'s no guarantee that we are going to be able to get to you in time, or even be able to find you.” \"OK,\" Baluchi replied. \"I\'m continuing.\" Three days later, Baluchi sent out a distress signal about 70 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, and a Coast Guard helicopter went to his location. He was airlifted to the Air Station Clearwater, but officials said he did not have any injuries. He seemed exhausted, they said. Instead of the approximately 1,000 miles he intended to travel, he made it about 300 miles north.
